## Ubuntu installation

Set `/boot` approximately 0.5 - 1Gb

Set `[SWAP]` equal to your RAM

Set `/home` approximately 60% of total disk

Set `/` all  of the rest space

No empty space left on .


Check disk partitions:

```bash
lsblk
```
should see something like:

## User management

1. Create one more user and make it root

```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash vasya
```

`-m` - makes home folder

`-s` - sets the default shell 

This will add user `vasya` to the system.

2. Set password for the user

```bash
sudo passwd vasya
```
Then enter the password

3. OPTIONALLY. you may set password expiration date for the user
```bash
passwd -e vasya 
```

OPTIONALLY : you may install `fish` as your default shell for the user


```bash
sudo apt-get install -y fish
```

To use it: 

add shell in the /etc/passwd for this user 
or edit with usermod:

```bash
sudo usermod -s /usr/bin/fish vasya
```

4. Make user `vasya` root

```bash
usermod -aG sudo vasya
```

Options  means `-a` -- append to `-G` group `sudo` for user `vasya`

Options `-a` and `-G` splits together to `-aG`


check user is root :

```bash
id vasya
```

Should see, that vasya has (sudo) group

### switch between users

switch to user `vasya`

```bash
su vasya
```

Switch to `root` user

```bash
sudo -i
```


## File and disk commands

Create a file:
```bash
touch file.txt
```
Creates empty file if not exist, otherwise updates the timestamp of file access time (atime)

Create a file in text redactor:
```bash
nano file.txt
```

Will open `file.txt` in nano redactor, if file not exist, it will be created.

Starting nano without filename will create empty file, and after editing on exit will ask which filename to save.


Saving file as a result of some command:

```bash
date > date.txt
``` 

Will execute `date` command and save the output to `date.txt` file.


## View file content

Show the content of `file.txt` in the terminal
```bash
cat file.txt
```


Show the first 25 lines of `file.txt`

```bash
head file.txt -n 25
```


Show the last 25 lines of `file.txt`
```bash
tail file.txt -n 25
```


Tail has a beautiful option `-f` which will show the file content in real time, and will update the content if file is updated.

```bash
tail -f log_file.txt
```

Especially useful for logs, when you want to see the updates in real time.

## Copy, Move, Delete

Copy:

`cp <source> <destination>`

Move:

`mv <source> <destination>`

Delete:

`rm path-to-file/file.txt`

Delete recursively:

`rm -r folder/`

Create Folder

`mkdir foldername`


Delete Folder

`rmdir foldername`

## Disk navigation

Change directory (go to some folder)

`cd foldername`

`foldername` is path , when it starts with `/` sign it will be the absolute path. 

If no `/` on the start it will look for the folder (path) in the current directory.

### Make file executable

To make file executable script, it should be modified with `chmod` command

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
``` 

`.sh` extension is not necessary, but it is a good practice to use it for shell scripts

## Process management

Process is a running instance of a program. It operates in the system memory, and has its own PID (process identifier). It occupies some system resources, like CPU, memory, files etc. Some processes started by the user (like commands you perform in terminal), some of them are system processes.

To view all processes dynamically use `top` command or `htop` command.

To view tree of processes and discover which are parents and which are children use `pstree` command. 

To stop (kill) the process use `kill` command with the process ID (PID) of the process.

Important to know about kill signals:
 - Option `-9` means sending `SIGKILL` signal to the process, which is the most powerful signal, and it will kill the process immediately - becauses it is **uncatchable** and **unignorable**. Other signals like `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT` can be caught by the process, and it can handle them, but `SIGKILL` is not.
 - Not every process can be killed, some of them are system processes, and they are necessary for the system to work properly. Killing them is restricted from user space, because they are processing in the kernel space
 - [Zombie](#what-is-zombie-process) processes cannot be killed by `kill -9`


To view static list of processes use `ps` command with options:

```bash
ps -eo pid,ppid,user,comm,stat,etime --sort=-etime | head -n 20
```

`-eo` means watch Every process with selected format output.

`--sort` means what metric to sort, may be used with `-` sign, meaning descending order.

Very useful columns to view (not the all possible but mostly used ):
- **pid** -- PID of the process, (process ideintifier)
- **ppid** -- Parent PID
- **user** -- user who initiated the process
- **etime** -- elapsed time  since the process was started (or **etimes** -- in seconds)
- **comm** -- command (only the executable name), or **exe** - path to the executable.
- **pmem** -- percent of memory

See the `man ps` manual for exhaustive reference


### What is zombie process?
A zombie process in Linux is a process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table. This happens when the process's parent process has not read its exit status via a system call like `wait()`.

Key points:
- Lifecycle: When a process finishes execution, it enters a "zombie" state to allow its parent to retrieve its exit status.
- Process Table Entry: The zombie process remains in the process table to store its exit information until the parent acknowledges it.
- Resource Usage: A zombie process doesn't use system resources (CPU or memory), but it occupies a slot in the process table.
- Resolution: If the parent process does not handle the zombie, it can lead to resource leaks. The init process (PID 1) will eventually adopt and clean it up if the parent terminates.

- To list zombie processes, use:
```bash
ps aux | grep Z
```
You can not just kill the zombie process, because it is already dead.

How to Handle Zombies Instead
1. Signal the Parent Process:
Use `kill -s SIGCHLD <PPID>` to inform the parent process to clean up the zombie by reading its exit status.

2. Terminate or Restart the Parent Process:
If the parent is not responding or malfunctioning, terminate it with `kill <PPID>`. This causes the zombie to be adopted by init (PID 1), which will automatically clean it up.

3. System Reboot:
As a last resort, rebooting the system will clear all zombie processes since the process table is reset.

## SSH connection

### Install SSH server
```bash
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
```

### Change SSH port
Edit ssh configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
In the file change `# Port 22` to `Port 3005` for example , set <30NN> where NN - is your number in Journal

### restart service

```bash
sudo service ssh restart
```

Add rule in the firewall to allow traffic on `3005` port: 

```bash
sudo ufw allow 3005
```

Check firewall settings with `ufw`

```bash
sudo ufw status
```
If you try to connect, error will be shown, because of the ssh is running on another port
```bash
ssh dmytro@172.20.10.6
ssh: connect to host 172.20.10.6 port 22: Connection refused
```
Connect to the server with the new port
```bash
ssh -p 3005 dmytro@172.20.10.6
```

## Copy file via SSH

Use `scp` command to copy files via SSH.

## from remote to local
```bash
scp -P 3005 ssh-admin@192.168.1.105:/home/ssh-admin/host-copy-file.txt ~/programm/tutorials/OS_tutorial 
```

Common syntax is: 
`scp <options> <source> <destination>`

OPTIONS: 

`-P` - (capital P) -- specifies port number

`-r` - copy recursively, e.g. entire folder 

Look closer what `<source>` consist of:

`<username>@<ip_address>:<path>`

`<destination>` -- is path

`~` in the start of the path means home directory of the user

`/` in the start of the path means root directory, absolute path

`./` in the start means current directory

`../` in the start means parent directory


## from local to remote


The same syntax, but source is your local path, and destination is remote.

Notice, source and destination are swapped and splitted with space.

```bash
scp -P 2002 ~/programm/tutorials/OS_tutorial/OS-helper/README.md ssh-admin@192.168.1.105:/home/ssh-admin/
```

## Crontab and at

Watch and check syntax here https://crontab.guru/


First of all check your host machine time:
```bash
date
```
Should see the current time of the host machine, notice if it will have different time zone or different time.

To set the time zone of the VM, use the following command:

```bash
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Kiev
```

### how to edit crontab

```bash
crontab -e
```

### how to list crontab

```bash
crontab -l
```

Example of the script to run every day at 09:00

```bash
0 9 * * * /bin/bash /home/everyday_video/silence_minute_play.sh
```

### How to run a script at a specific time 

To run `at` in terminal and provide the command to run at a specific time:

```bash
at 09:00
```
Then provide the command to run at this time:

```bash
/bin/bash /home/everyday_video/silence_minute_play.sh
```
To finish editing, press **Ctrl+D**

#### View the scheduled tasks

To view the task that were scheduled with `at` command, use the following command:
```bash
atq
```

#### Remove the scheduled task

To remove the task, use the following command:

```bash
atrm <task_number>
```
The <task_number> you can get from the `atq` command output.


## Record your terminal
To start recording with script, provide two destination files: a timing file and a typescript file:
    
```bash
script --timing=time.tm myscript
```
Script will record all the commands, you perform in terminal, their outputs etc. All you have done will be saved to the `myscript` file, and timing to the `time.tm` file.

To replay the script, use the following command:

```bash
scriptreplay --timing=time.tm myscript
```

You will see the same commands, you have performed in the terminal, and their outputs. 

Magic!

# Network troubleshoot

Example how to set IP address to the interface manually:

```bash
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.111/24 dev enp0s8
```

IP address should be in the same network as the router (host PC), and the same network mask.


# Docker minimal setup

To install follow instructions from https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository

After the installation, it is very helpful to add your username to `docker` group, so you can run docker commands without `sudo`:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Now you can run docker commands without `sudo`

### docker commands

To download some image, for example `nginx`:

```bash
docker pull nginx
```

To run some container:

```bash
docker run --name nginx_container -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

This command will start container from image `nginx`, and will redirect port 8080 from host machine to 80 port inside docker container.

`--name` - sets the name of the container

`-d` - runs container in detached mode

`-p` - redirects ports from host to container

To check running containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see the running container `nginx_container`:

```bash
 docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                                     NAMES
d58d48de7838   nginx     "/docker-entrypoint.…"   7 seconds ago   Up 7 seconds   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, :::8080->80/tcp         nginx_container
``` 

To stop the container you may use `docker stop` command with name of the container or container ID:

```bash
docker stop nginx_container
```
or 

```bash
docker stop d58d48de7838
```
