# Git Collaboration Exercise: Frontend + Backend Team Practice - Complete Guide

## Overview
This exercise simulates a real-world collaborative development scenario where two developers work on the same project using Git best practices. You'll practice repository management, branch protection, pull requests, and team workflows.

**Duration**: 60-120 minutes  
**Team**: 2 students  
**Focus**: Git workflow, collaboration, branch management

### Roles Assignment
- **Student A**: Repository Owner (can be Frontend or Backend developer)
- **Student B**: Collaborator (can be Backend or Frontend developer)
- Which developer is the owner doesn't matter - focus on Git workflow

### Project Context
You're building a simple web application called "TaskMaster" - a task management tool (or choose your own project). The specific implementation doesn't matter; focus on the Git workflow.

## 🔍 Post-Exercise Discussion Questions

### Essential Understanding:
1. **Branch Strategy**: Why did we use `dev` as an integration branch instead of merging directly to `main`?
   - *Answer: Protects main branch, allows integration testing, mirrors real-world workflows*

2. **Commit Messages**: How do good commit messages help in collaborative development?
   - *Answer: Clear project history, easier debugging, better collaboration, professional standards*

3. **Code Review**: What are the benefits of the pull request review process?
   - *Answer: Knowledge sharing, bug prevention, code quality, team collaboration*

4. **Branch Protection**: Why is branch protection important in team environments?
   - *Answer: Prevents accidental changes, enforces workflow, maintains code quality*

5. **Documentation**: How does good documentation facilitate team collaboration?
   - *Answer: Onboarding, clarity, maintenance, knowledge sharing*

### Advanced Discussion:
6. **Most useful Git commands**: What do they do and when to use them?
   - `git status` - Check working directory status
   - `git branch -a` - View all branches (local and remote)
   - `git checkout -b` - Create and switch to new branch
   - `git pull origin dev` - Update local branch with remote changes
   - `git log --oneline --graph` - View commit history visually
   - `git remote -v` - Check remote repository URLs

7. **Merge Strategies**: When would you use "Squash and merge" vs "Merge commit"?
   - *Squash: Clean linear history, single feature commits*
   - *Merge commit: Preserve detailed development history*
